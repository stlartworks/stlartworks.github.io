### Youth Opportunities Tax Credit Program (YOP)

If you are liable for Missouri taxes (individuals and corporations) you could take advantage of St. Louis ArtWorks’ status as a YOP approved organization. The Missouri Department of Economic Development awarded YOP Tax credits to qualified organizations which broaden and strengthen opportunities for positive development and participation in community life for youth.

<b>Missouri Taxpayers:</b> St. Louis ArtWorks contributors receive 50% of their monetary contribution in tax credits to offset their Missouri state tax liability, with up to a five-year carry forward. The benefit also provides great impact as the contributor's tax credits redirect tax dollars back into our community.

<i>*Note: Consult your tax advisor for further guidance on how these rules apply to you individually.</i>

To learn more about YOP tax credit opportunities, please contact Priscilla Block, Executive Director, priscilla.block@stlartworks.org or call 314-899-9734.

Or, visit our [Youth Opportunities Program (YOP) Tax Credits page](/yop-tax-credits/)

Here are a few volunteer opportunities available with ArtWorks in 2016. If you are interested in volunteering, please indicate your area of interest and availability in the above box marked "additional comments". Thank you for your support!

<b><i>Volunteer Opportunities include:</b></i>

<b>INTERVIEW DAY VOLUNTEERS</b>

Summer Interview Day: Saturday, April 23 8:30am-2pm<br> 
Fall Interview Day: Saturday, August 27, 9am-2pm

As part of the interview process, interested youth must interview for positions with St. Louis ArtWorks. We need volunteers to assist with the Interview Day for potential apprentices at our studio 5959 Delmar. We ask for a 2-hour commitment, but welcome any time you are able to give. Whenever possible, we try to pair interviewers to meet with each apprentice-applicant for 20-25 minutes.
 
The interview questions are provided in advance,  as well as tips on conducting a successful interview with a teenager.

Volunteers report that this is the best and most engaging experience they have enjoyed with St. Louis ArtWorks. Participating in the Interview Day makes a lasting contribution to the work we do.
