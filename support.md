Every dollar you donate is an investment to provide quality job training and art education for teens who otherwise might not have the opportunity to bring home a paycheck, while learning valuable job and life skills. Your donation helps provide apprentices with the best teaching artists and ensures that we can provide the materials and tools they need to exercise their full creative potential as they learn. 

### Here's what your gift can accomplish:

* $30 will cover the cost of 1 participant in our After-School Program for 1 week.
* $75 can provide uniforms for 12 Apprentices.
* $150 can buy food for the After-School Program.
* $350 can fund an After-School Apprentice stipend for an entire semester.
* $1,000 is enough to fund an Apprentice stipend for the entire summer.

### Youth Opportunities Tax Credit Program (YOP)

If you are liable for Missouri taxes (individuals and corporations) you could take advantage of St. Louis ArtWorksâ€™ status as a YOP approved organization. The Missouri Department of Economic Development awarded YOP Tax credits to qualified organizations which broaden and strengthen opportunities for positive development and participation in community life for youth.

<b>Missouri Taxpayers:</b> St. Louis ArtWorks contributors receive 50% of their monetary contribution in tax credits to offset their Missouri state tax liability, with up to a five-year carry forward. The benefit also provides great impact as the contributor's tax credits redirect tax dollars back into our community.

<i>*Note: Consult your tax advisor for further guidance on how these rules apply to you individually.</i>

To learn more about YOP tax credit opportunities, please contact Priscilla Block, Executive Director at <a href="mailto: priscilla.block@stlartworks.org">priscilla.block@stlartworks.org</a> or call 314-899-9734.

Or, visit our [Youth Opportunities Program (YOP) Tax Credits page](/yop-tax-credits/)
