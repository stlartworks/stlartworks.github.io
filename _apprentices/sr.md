ArtWorks has inspired me to continue to pursue my dream of becoming a working artist.  Despite what has been said about the difficulty level, and outcome of becoming an artist, I am convinced that this is something close to my heart and well worth fighting for.

Here at St. Louis ArtWorks, when screen printing, we use silk screens, squeeges, and water based ink along with transferring images on frabrics.  We usually try our best to clean up our materials and tools here at the end of the work day.  For our screen printing, the apprentices split into two groups, each coming up with their own design as separate teams without competition.  For the designs, we looked at our inspiration from artists such as Matt Vogel and Andy Warhol and Angela Davis. We not only do this to make money, but we also do it because we enjoy art.
