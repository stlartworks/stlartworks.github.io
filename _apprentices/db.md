This Summer Was My First Time Working For You Guys And I Can Say It Was Great. I Had Really Fun,I Met New Friends And I Got To Build A Resume. My Favorite Part About Artwork Is You Get To Meet New People That Like Doing The Samething's You Like To Do. I Think St.louis Artwork Is A Good Job For Your Child To Have Because They Don't Just Teach About Art. They Teach You How To Budget Your Money For The Future.Which That Is A Good Idea For Your Child To Be Learning At A Young Age. I Loved St.louis Artworks So Much That I Recommended A lot Of My Family Members.I'm Thankful For St.louis Artwork, They Taught Me Some Things And I Made New Friends.  Thank you Again I Appreciate Working For  St louis Artwork
