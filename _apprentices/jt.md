Being in ArtWorks this session has really taught me that a person has hidden talents.  Coming into this session, I had no idea what Silk Screening was.  I thought that it would be difficult, but it turned out to be very easy.  As the session went by, I began to perfect Silk Screening.  I realized that it was my hiddent talent.  Being here, the teaching artists have inspired me.  They inspire me because they took their knowledge and taught us something that we could use in the future.  I enjoyed learning something now and meeting new people who had the same interest that I had in art.  I’ve learned how to voice my opinions and Ive learned how to collaborate with others.
