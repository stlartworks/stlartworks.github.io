    As a mother of three grown sons, and a retired elementary school teacher of
    25 years, Kath has retooled for a new career in Art Therapy.  She holds a
    Masters in Art Therapy from St. Mary-of-the-Woods College, and she is a
    member of Missouri Art Therapy Association (MATA) and Gateway East Art Guild
    (GEAG). She enjoys drawing, painting, and quilting, with creating mandalas
    as her favorite art process.  Kath’s goals are to effectively support
    Apprentices, Teaching Artists, and staff by facilitating a “bridge” between
    art-making and emotions.  This enhances the development of self-esteem and
    self-awareness, cognitive and sensory-motor awareness, and the cultivation
    of emotional awareness.
