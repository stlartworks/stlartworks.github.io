    Clayton Petras is a St Louis based Printmaker. A son of a military family, he attended St Louis University High-school while stationed at Scott Air Force Base, then going on to receive his Bachelor’s in Fine Arts from University of South Florida in Tampa and then returning to St Louis for his Master’s of Fine Arts from Washington University.
    
    In his work, he looks for ways to visualize and document the degenerative mental disease of Parkinson’s and transform it into portrayals of the disease itself, its effects, and those it afflicts. Being a physical breakdown of the body, both popular culture and his corporal understanding influence the interpretation and representation.
    
    In depicting the uncontrollable symptoms (tremors, stiffness, depression, mania, etc.) and through attempting its visualization in the abstract, these imprinted marks, combined with a societal understanding of disease and the body, shows the various ways in which he views this chronological breakdown of the mind and body. Parkinson’s being a disease hard to diagnose before its symptoms set in, many of our medical imaging technologies cannot picture it. His work attempts to do this, giving identity to both Parkinson’s as a disease and capturing the shifting identities of those it afflicts.
