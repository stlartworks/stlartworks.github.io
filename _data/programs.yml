  content: Rain barrels are a popular request at St. Louis ArtWorks, offering a GREAT eco-friendly way to keep your garden watered all season long, prevent storm water runoff and save on your water-usage bill! But why choose a plain, boring barrel, when you could have a work of art to enhance your outdoor landscape?! This spring, our Painting apprentices will transform boring to beautiful and offer these functional works of art for sale to the public at the end of April. After all, April showers bring May flowers!
