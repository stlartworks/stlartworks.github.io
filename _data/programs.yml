  content: Rain barrels are a popular request at St. Louis ArtWorks, offering a GREAT eco-friendly way to keep your garden watered all season long, prevent storm water runoff and save on your water-usage bill! But why choose a plain, boring barrel, when you could have a work of art to enhance your outdoor landscape?! This spring, our Painting apprentices will transform boring to beautiful and offer these functional works of art for sale to the public at the end of April. After all, April showers bring May flowers!

  content: This spring, our troupe of apprentice dancers will perform a modern piece titled, “Stepping Off the Tracks”. Through the medium of dance, St. Louis ArtWorks intends to bring awareness to the economic divide that Delmar represents in the St. Louis region, by creating pop-up performances focused on transportation and its role in both bridging and dividing communities.

  content:  In our fourth documentary film, St. Louis ArtWorks apprentices will share the story of local blues and ragtime music and the evolution from its early roots in Missouri, to its impact and influence in modern music. "St. Louis Notes in History: Ragtime and Blues” will share how St. Louis has been a vital part of the confluence of ‘river’ music that flowed to the north from New Orleans, to the south from Chicago, and how ragtime music became the foundation for much of the modern blues, R&B, and hip-hop we know today.
