Applications for Fall 2018 apprentices are CLOSED. Further updates to follow for the Spring 2019 application!

We invite young creatives (14 - 18 years old) in the St. Louis metro area to apply and earn a stipend through paid apprenticeships in the arts in the Fall, Spring, and Summer.

Applying for a St. Louis ArtWorks apprenticeship is NOT first-come, first-served. Teens interested in working for St. Louis ArtWorks must:

1) Be at least 14 years old,

2) Complete the online application (below),

3) Get a letter of recommendation sent to ArtWorks by a non-family member (teacher, after-school activity supervisor, church member, etc.)

4) Be selected for and attend an in-person interview at St. Louis ArtWorks (5959 Delmar Blvd., St. Louis, MO 63112),

5) A commitment of five hours a week (2.5 hours after school Tuesdays & Thursdays OR 5 hours on Saturdays), starting Saturday, January 26, through Saturday, April 27. All apprentices including the Tuesday/Thursday apprentices are required to work on April 28, when ArtWorks hosts our Annual Spring Sale. Attendance on April 28 is part of the program's required participation.&nbsp;
