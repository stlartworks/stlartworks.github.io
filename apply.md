St. Louis ArtWorks is not accepting applications for Spring 2017.  Applications for SUMMER 2017 will open in February.

Young creatives (14 - 18 years old) in the St. Louis metro area can earn a stipend through paid apprenticeships in the arts in the Fall, Spring, and Summer. 

THANK YOU for your interest and support of teen employment and the arts in St. Louis!
