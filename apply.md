We invite young creatives (14 - 18 years old) in the St. Louis metro area to apply and earn a stipend through paid apprenticeships in the arts in the Fall, Spring, and Summer. 

Applications for SUMMER 2017 apprenticeships will be available here on February 15! Applying for a St. Louis ArtWorks apprenticeship is NOT first-come, first-served. Teens interested in working for St. Louis ArtWorks must: 

1) Be at least 14 years old by January 1, 2017,
2) Complete the online application (applications will open on February 15, 2017), 
2) Get a letter of recommendation sent to ArtWorks by a non-family member (teacher, after-school activity supervisor, church member, etc.)
3) Be selected for and attend an in-person interview at St. Louis ArtWorks in April (5959 Delmar Blvd., St. Louis, MO 63112),
