BoomerRacks are bicycle racks with heart, purpose, and a sense of fun:  BoomerRacks are fashioned from repurposed bicycle parts, which are revitalized and crafted into durable, kinesthetic art. More than 25 of these functional works of art are installed in locations throughout St. Louis City and County.
