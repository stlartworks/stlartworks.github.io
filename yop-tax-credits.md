St. Louis ArtWorks is proud to offer State of Missouri Youth Opportunities Program (YOP) Tax Credits to our contributors. Please specify that you would like to utilize these tax credits upon making your donation.

## Youth Opportunities Program (YOP) Tax Credits

If you are liable for Missouri taxes (individuals and corporations) you could take advantage of St. Louis ArtWorksâ€™ status as a YOP approved organization. The Missouri Department of Economic Development awarded YOP Tax credits to qualified organizations which broaden and strengthen opportunities for positive development and participation in community life for youth, and to discourage young people in our communities from engaging in criminal and violent behavior.

Missouri Taxpayers: St. Louis ArtWorks contributors receive 50% of their monetary contribution in tax credits to offset their Missouri state tax liability, with up to a five-year carry forward. The benefit also provides great impact as the contributor's tax credits redirect tax dollars back into our community. <i>*Note: Consult your tax advisor for further guidance on how these rules apply to you individually.</i>

To learn more about YOP tax credit opportunities, please contact Priscilla Block, Executive Director, priscilla.block@stlartworks.org or 314-899-9734.

The taxpayer may then file their tax return at the end of their tax year, using the MO-TC form. The tax credits are applied to their total tax liability incurred for that tax period. 

For example: a contributor makes a $1,000 contribution to an approved YOP project:
<br>Total tax liability for tax year 20XX: $2,000
<br>Tax Credits: $500
<br>Adjusted tax liability $: $1,500

A. Yes. A donor may receive no more than $200,000 in YOP tax credits in one tax year for contributions made to one or more YOP approved projects unless the projects are located in blighted or distressed areas of the state.
 
### Q. If the donor does not have tax liability in the tax year the contribution is made, can the credits be used on subsequent tax returns?
A. Yes. The contributor has the tax year the contribution was given and five succeeding tax periods in which to use the credits.
 
### Q. Are the tax credits sellable or transferable?
