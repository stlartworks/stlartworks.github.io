ArtWorks provides apprentices the opportunity to have in-depth employment experiences where they learn the business of art, improve their artistic skills, and gain social and soft skills required for professional success.

### The &quot;Apprentices&quot;

Every teen accepted into our program works as an &quot;apprentice&quot; alongside a professional artist to learn a multitude of creative skills. All of the projects are either sold at a public sale, commissioned for public and private clients, or performed publicly.

### Established in 1995

ArtWorks has worked with over 2,800 underserved youth from the St. Louis Region. Apprentices take away a long lasting set of experiences, as well as a resume and portfolio of real work and references.
