We are excited to give young creatives (14 - 19 years old) paying jobs. The majority of our funding is to empower African-American teens living in the city of St. Louis. Yet, we are forever growing our program to include as many teens as we can. We are committed to helping our brothers and sisters of STL. And we are committed to diversifying our program as much as possible.

### The "Apprentices"
Every teen accepted into our program works as an "apprentice" alongside a professional artist to learn a multitude of creative skills. All of the projects are either sold at a public sale, commissioned for public and private clients, or performed publicly.

### Established in 1995  
ArtWorks has worked with over 2,700 underserved youth from the St. Louis Region. Apprentices take away a long lasting set of experiences, as well as a resume and portfolio of real work and references.
