We are fortunate to have these amazing people on our Board of Directors. Among them are designers, business professionals, social workers, lawyers, scientists, entrepreneurs, teachers, developers, urban planners, and more. St. Louis ArtWorks' dedicated Board helps move our programming forward with generous amounts of time, brain power, and fundraising efforts. They are people who care and collaborate to make a difference in the lives of St. Louis youth and our community. Thank you all!
