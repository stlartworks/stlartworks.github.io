Friday, May 5, 2017 - 6:00 PM – 10:00 PM

On May 5, 2017, we will invite friends, new and old to join us for a party that only St. Louis ArtWorks would throw, the Young at Art celebration of ArtWorks accomplishments, accolades and aspirations.We are so proud of our accomplishments in these first 21 years and now we are excited to build on the momentum of the National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Award. This spring we are hosting what we hope will be our biggest fundraising event in our history. We are honored to welcome St. Louis Jazz great, Denise Thimes as our emcee and featured performer. Young at Art guests will enjoy delicious cocktails before a dinner that is artistically inspired and specially prepared for them. At St. Louis ArtWorks, we believe in hands-on art training, so we’ll be inviting our guests to participate in art experiences throughout the event from photo booths to a large-scale art installation.  Of course, this is a fundraiser and our apprentices are hard at work creating one-of-a-kind works of art that will be available in a silent auction.

Honorary Event Chairs:
Maxine Clark & Bob Fox
Ken & Nancy Kranzberg
Sandra & Eric Moore Sr.
