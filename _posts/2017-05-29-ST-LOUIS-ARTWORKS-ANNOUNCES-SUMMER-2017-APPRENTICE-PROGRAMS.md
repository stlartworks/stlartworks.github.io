ST. LOUIS – St. Louis ArtWorks is gearing up for the organization’s busiest time of year- the Summer Apprentice Programs.  More than 67 youth apprentices between the ages of 14 and 18 will be participating in this Summer’s program which will offer disciplines in three-dimensional design, video and sound design, painting, and sculpture.  The program runs June 12 to July 21, Monday-Friday 9:00am-3:30pm, with a public celebration and Summer Sale on Saturday, July 22nd.

Shakira Onwuachi is excited to be serving as St. Louis ArtWorks’ Interim Program Manager for the Summer.  Ms. Onwuachi will graduate with her Masters in Social Work from the Brown School at Washington University in May 2018.  She started at St. Louis ArtWorks as a practicum student in January of this year.  Her role as Interim Program Manager is in alignment with her plan to pursue a career in Community Development working with Youth & Families.  “I am passionate about social entrepreneurship, using the Arts for wellness purposes, and empowering youth to be active participants in developing their communities,” Shakira explains. “I am enthusiastic about this opportunity, and I am looking forward to a rewarding and productive Summer Program.”

In a partnership with Great Rivers Greenway and Big Muddy National Fish and Wildlife Refuge, St. Louis ArtWorks will be featuring a three-dimensional design program this Summer called BloomWorks.  Teaching Artists Hap Phillips and Stephanie Nelson will be leading the Summer Apprentices in this group as they create a commissioned piece to be installed at the head of the Katy Trail.  The piece will reflect the importance of preserving our natural watersheds.  Apprentices will also be creating decorative “Little Libraries” that will be available for sale at the end of the Summer Program.  The BloomWorks Summer 2017 Program is funded by a grant from Missouri American Water.

In the BoomerRacks program, Apprentices will learn the discipline of sculpture as they create a commissioned bike rack for America’s Central Port in Grafton, Illinois.  Utilizing recycled bike parts they will create a custom bike rack. Apprentices will be creating individual sculptures using bike parts which will be available for purchase at the Summer Sale.  Teaching Artists Deborah Wheeler and Colton Carter will lead this group which is funded by support from America’s Central Port and the William A. Kerr Foundation.

Through the creation of a mural for the North Sarah community, Apprentices in The Muralists group this Summer will hone their individual styles as they learn about painting, color and design, and the history of Turner Park as they create this commissioned piece for Urban Strategies.  Teaching Artists Stajah Curry and Byron Rogers will be leading this program which is supported by the St. Louis Art Museum and funding from McCormack Barron Salazar.

Teaching Artists Mark Clark and Ben Clark will be leading an innovative Sight & Sound program this Summer which has been commissioned by supporters at Young at Art, St. Louis ArtWorks’ recent fundraising gala.  Using video and sound design, Apprentices will create an interactive multimedia experience in the Emerson Media Lab at St. Louis ArtWorks.  The project will debut at the Summer Sale on Saturday, July 22, and will feature immersive sound and video elements.  The Apprentices in this group will also create individual 30-second pieces available for sale on CDs.

The 2017 Summer Apprentice Program will conclude with a celebration and Summer Sale on Saturday, July 22, 2017 from 11:00am-2:00pm at St. Louis ArtWorks on 5959 Delmar Blvd. in the East Loop.  Friends, family, and the general public are invited to attend the event to view the incredible work the Apprentices have created throughout the Summer Program and to purchase individual works of art.
