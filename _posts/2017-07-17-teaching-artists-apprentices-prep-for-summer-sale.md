ST. LOUIS – St. Louis ArtWorks is excitedly preparing for one of the biggest days of the year - the
Summer Sale! Seventy youth Apprentices between the ages of 14 and 18 have been working under
Teaching Artists in disciplines including three-dimensional design, video and sound design, painting,
and sculpture. In addition to their commissions in each discipline, the youth are creating individual
works of art that will be available at the sale. Friends, family, and supporters of all ages are
invited to this public celebration on Friday, July 21st from 11:00am to 2:00pm at St. Louis
ArtWorks on 5959 Delmar Blvd. in the East Loop to view the incredible artwork the Apprentices
have created.

“I’m looking forward to opening our doors and letting the community have a chance to see the high
quality of work these super talented young artists have created this Summer in such a short period of
time,” brags Shakira Onwuachi, Interim Program Manager.

In the BoomerRacks program, Apprentices have been busy creating a variety of small-scale
sculptures that will be available for purchase including decorative garden ornaments, windchimes,
plexiglass stenciling, wood burnings, coat racks, tie holders and towel racks made from
upcycled bike parts. They have also created a commissioned bike rack for America’s Central Port,
and models of the rack in fabrication will be on display. Apprentices in The Muralists group have been
learning about painting, color and design through the creation of a mural for Turner Park which will be
on display during the sale. The Apprentices will also be selling individual works in various styles
including surreal, graffiti, and anime-inspired painting and prints. In the innovative Sight &
Sound program, Apprentices are using video and sound design to create an immersive multimedia
experience in the Emerson Media Lab. The project will feature abstract videos set to original music
tracks created by the young artists. Apprentices in the three-dimensional design program called
BloomWorks have been creating a commissioned sculpture to be installed near the Katy Trail that
reflects the importance of preserving our natural watersheds. Apprentices are also building decorative
Little Lending Libraries that will be available for purchase during the sale.

Attendees at the Summer Sale are welcome to tour the facility at St. Louis ArtWorks which is used not
only for the Apprentice Program, but for fundraising events, private parties, and community
engagements. Guests can also grab a bite to eat at the STL French Quarter Food Truck which will
be parked on-site throughout lunch. For more information and to view their menu, visit

Louis City or County.
