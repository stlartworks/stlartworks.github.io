<i>May 23, 2016, St. Louis, MO</i> - A new sculpture, designed by 20 St. Louis ArtWorks apprentices and commissioned by The Nature Conservancy, will be dedicated on Tuesday, June 7th at Edgar M. Queeny Park in St. Louis County at 9a.m. The sculpture was recently installed on the banks of Owl Creek, a tributary of the Meramec River, as part of the “Growing a Healthy Meramec” project. 

The Growing a Healthy Meramec  project, funded through a $100,000 gift from The Boeing Company, raises awareness of the importance of this freshwater resource, and demonstrates how native plants keep our rivers healthy by stabilizing streambanks and slowing runoff. 

The 8-foot tall stainless steel sculpture, titled “Where Rivers Flow, Trees Grow”, depicts a fish-filled stream flowing into a majestic tree with leafy branches. Native plants help maintain the health of our vital water resources, such as wildlife habitat, drinking water, and recreational opportunities. 

The apprentices gained inspiration for the sculpture design during tours of key waterways in the St. Louis-area.  “We took our sketchbooks, to draw animals and plants we saw along the creek and rivers,” said Tyson, an apprentice with the sculpture team.  “We saw fish, turtles, and birds, and decided on an owl in the tree, to represent Owl Creek.”

Dr. Steve Herrington, the Conservancy’s Missouri Director of Freshwater Conservation, led the tour and a discussion about the water cycle and the importance of protecting our water resources.

 “This project brings together the emotion evoked by art, and the empiricism of science,” said Herrington. “It’s great to see the apprentices get excited about our natural world, and it was a wonderful opportunity to show them how we can keep our waters clean and healthy.”

A second component of the project included two tree plantings, which were completed by the Ozark Regional Land Trust and the Open Space Council for the St. Louis Region.  More than 4,000 Oak, Hickory and native Missouri woodland tree seedlings were planted in Queeny Park, including the areas near Owl Creek - an ideal site, as existing conservation efforts at the park increase success rates and reduce maintenance costs. 

The Growing a Healthy Meramec project is part of Water Matters, a regional initiative headed up by The Nature Conservancy and the Nine Network of Public Media, to raise awareness and understanding of the connection between the health of our water and the health of our lands, people, and economies.

The Meramec River is a critical water resource for St. Louisans and native wildlife. It provides drinking water to 70,000 households and supports a variety of species, such as elephant-ear mussels and crystal darter minnows, some of which are found nowhere else on Earth. The Meramec is remarkably diverse and intact, but its health is at risk from excessive sediment and runoff. The Nature Conservancy is working with partners to protect this important river, starting with a groundbreaking conservation action plan completed in 2014 (nature.org/meramecrivercap).
