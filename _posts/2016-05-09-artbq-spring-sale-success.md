<i>May 9, 2016, St. Louis, MO</i> – More than 150 people came together with Honorary Chairman Joe Edwards to cut the ribbon and celebrate St. Louis ArtWorks move to 5959 Delmar at the ART-B-Q on Friday, April 29, 2016. Combined with the Annual Spring Art Sale on Saturday, April 30th, the weekend events raised more than $13,000 to support ArtWorks’ year-round arts apprenticeship programs for teens ages 14-18.

Guests of the ART-B-Q were treated to original works of art created by ArtWorks apprentices during the spring program, including paintings, garden art and furniture, and hand-painted rain barrels to beautify St. Louis gardens. In addition to the apprentices’ art, the night included the official ribbon cutting at 5959 Delmar, a DJ performance by Board Member Stan Chisolm, aka 18andCounting, as well as BBQ-style hors d’oeuvres and drinks.

“It was wonderful to see so many long-time supporters and new friends of ArtWorks at this event,” said Andréa Purnell, ArtWorks’ Program Manager.  “These new studios and MakerSpace offer so much to the apprentices and to the community-at-large,” she added.

One of the highlights of the evening was the premiere of “The Delmar Connection,” a 15-minute documentary produced by spring apprentices at ArtWorks. Many St. Louisans are familiar with the term “the Delmar divide”, but this project sought out the experiences and neighborhood development that is once again connecting Delmar and its surrounding communities.  

“The Delmar Connection” was created by St. Louis ArtWorks in partnership with Continuity, a non-profit organization which provides mentorship and training in media production to people age 18+, and supported by Missouri Humanities Council.

The success of the 2016 ART-B-Q was due in large to its Lead Sponsor, Hudson and Associates, Sculptor Level Sponsors Nestle Purina, St. Louis Community College at Forest Park, Equifax, the Department of Health & Senior Services – Office of Minority Health, and Printmaker Level Sponsors Max Burton, Greensfelder, Hemker & Gale, P.C., Ken and Nancy Kranzberg, Urban Strategies and Southwest Airlines. Thanks also to Bowood Farms, for providing beautiful blooms to bring Spring to ArtWorks’ tables.

On Saturday, April 30, apprentices shared their work with the public-at-large at ArtWorks Annual Spring Art Sale. At the end of each program session, apprentices participate in a public sale of their work, to put in action the skills they have learned in professional communication and artistic expression. ArtWorks programs offer training in a variety of art disciplines, including traditional and digital arts, as well as 21st century skills, such as workplace communication and fiscal responsibility.
