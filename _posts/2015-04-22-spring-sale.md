Come welcome warm weather with us on Saturday, May 2nd (11a-2p) at our Old North Studio 2707 N 14th Street

The sale will feature painted rain barrels, wood burned signs for the home and garden, bird houses, cards, and other handmade items all designed by our youth.

We'll also be showcasing our collaborative stop motion film with the New Art in the Neighborhood program from the Contemporary Art Museum.

Spread the word, shop local and help support our programs and teens.
