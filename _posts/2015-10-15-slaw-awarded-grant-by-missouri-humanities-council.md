St. Louis, Missouri – The Missouri Humanities Council (MHC) has awarded a grant of $5,000 to St. Louis ArtWorks in support of “The Delmar Connection” project.

The MHC is the only state-wide agency in Missouri devoted exclusively to humanities education for citizens of all ages. It has served as a state affiliate of the National Endowment for the Humanities since 1971.

“The Delmar Connection” project will employ apprentices in the media arts to document the rich history and cultural significance of transportation and street cars on Delmar Boulevard.  Apprentices who complete the program will develop artistic skills in videography, demonstrate an increase in work readiness skills and increase their cultural and historical knowledge of St. Louis and the social, economic, and cultural impact of street cars on the region.

St. Louis area teens age 14-19 may apply for a spring apprenticeship with ArtWorks starting on November 1, 2015 by visiting stlartworks.org and completing an application. Eligible applicants will be interviewed and selected in December and begin their apprenticeships in January. Spring teams will complete their projects and commissions by the end of April, where the apprentices will share their work through a public presentation and sale.

The Mission of St. Louis ArtWorks is to broaden educational and career opportunities for youth in the St. Louis region through apprenticeships in the arts and through community collaborations.

Youth apprentice with professional artists in the visual, literary, and performing arts. In addition to developing talent in artistic disciplines, ArtWorks teaches the business of being an artist, as well as helping the young art entrepreneurs develop positive social, creative-thinking, teamwork, personal finance, and character education skills.

This year marks ArtWorks’ 20th year of providing workforce development training to underserved St. Louis area youth. In August of 2015, ArtWorks relocated to [5959 Delmar Boulevard in the Loop East](https://www.google.com/maps/place/5959+delmar+blvd,+63112/@38.6548327,-90.2927532,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xef4a139e5304dde7).
