ST. LOUIS – On Friday, May 5, 2017 St. Louis ArtWorks hosted Young at Art, a celebration of St. Louis ArtWorks’ accomplishments, accolades, and aspirations. The first event of its kind for the organization, Young at Art raised proceeds of over $100,000 through tickets, silent auction, and a live Fund-It-Forward auction. The incredible success of the event was largely made possible by the outstanding event co-chairs: Maxine Clark & Bob Fox, Ken & Nancy Kranzberg, and Sandra & Eric Moore, along with lead sponsors Emerson & Wells Fargo Advisors.

As guests arrived at St. Louis ArtWorks’ facility in the East Loop, they were greeted by live mural painting by well-known local artist Robert A. Ketchens and youth apprentices from the Spring 2017 program.  The silent auction featured luxury travel destinations, live entertainment experiences, and one-of-a-kind works including jewelry, paintings, and art created by ArtWorks Apprentices.  During the cocktail hour, guests were treated to a pop-up dance performance by the Spring 2017 Dance Apprentices as they performed their piece “Stepping Off The Tracks.”  While guests enjoyed dinner by With Love Catering, they watched a documentary short film created by the Spring 2017 Apprentices entitled “Blues & Ragtime: The Sounds of St. Louis.”  Following dessert, there was a brief history of the organization, a few words from ArtWorks Apprentices Angel Stanton and Annalise Cason, and a celebration of the organization’s 2016 National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Award. Attendees showed their support of St. Louis ArtWorks’ future growth by pledging over $37,000 during the Fund-It-Forward live auction.

The organization was fortunate to have St. Louis jazz great Denise Thimes as the event MC and entertainment for the evening.  She and her band were joined onstage by Gene Dobbs Bradford and Nancy Kranzberg for a delightful rendition of St. Louie Blues to end the night with a bang. 

“I continue to be amazed at the generosity of our supporters and their commitment to help St. Louis ArtWorks broaden educational and career opportunities for youth in the St. Louis region,” stated Priscilla Block, Executive Director of St. Louis ArtWorks. “Young at Art was both a celebration of our accomplishments and an opportunity for the community to come together in support of our youth.  We are forever grateful to our long-time supporters and we welcome the new friends and funders we met at Young at Art.”

Young at Art was made possible by generous sponsorship from Emerson, Wells Fargo Advisors, Equifax, the Clark/Fox Foundation, Ken & Nancy Kranzberg, Laura Cohen, Hudson & Associates, UMB, Clayco, Purina, and IFF. 

St. Louis ArtWorks was founded in 1995 as a collaborative partnership with Grand Center Inc., the City of St. Louis, and the Regional Arts Commission. Since that time, ArtWorks has provided opportunities for thousands of young people, successfully helping to prepare them for future education and employment opportunities. ArtWorks bridges economic, racial and social divisions by providing underserved youth with arts education, workforce development training, and 21st century life skills, including fiscal literacy and professional communication. Funds raised at the Young at Art event will support these wonderful and vital programs.
