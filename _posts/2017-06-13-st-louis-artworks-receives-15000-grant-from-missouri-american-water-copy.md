ST. LOUIS – Missouri American Water, a supplier of clean water and waste-water services to
approximately 1.5 million customers across the state, has provided St. Louis ArtWorks with a
$15,000 environmental grant. The funding is being used to support one of ArtWorks’ Summer
Apprentice Programs called BloomWorks.

In a partnership with Great Rivers Greenway and Big Muddy National Fish and Wildlife
Refuge , St. Louis ArtWorks will be providing job training through a three-dimensional design
program where teen Apprentices will create a wayfinding sculpture depicting the Missouri River
Watershed that will be installed near Boone’s Crossing at the Katy Trail. Teaching Artists Hap
Phillips and Stephanie Nelson Pondrom will be leading the BloomWorks group as they create this
commissioned piece.

The grant marks the first time St. Louis ArtWorks has received funding from Missouri American
Water. Executive Director Priscilla Block acknowledged “This is an exciting opportunity to bring like
minded collaborators together to support job training and environmental education for area teens.
We are grateful for this generous support from Missouri American Water.”

The BloomWorks program is one of four Apprentice programs running this Summer at St. Louis
ArtWorks. Nearly 70 underserved youth from St. Louis City and County are participating in
disciplines such as painting, sculpture, video and sound design. The Summer Apprentice Program
will conclude with a public celebration and Summer Sale on Friday, July 21st from 11:00 a.m. to
2:00 p.m. at St. Louis ArtWorks on 5959 Delmar Blvd in the East Loop. Friends, family, and
supporters of ArtWorks are encouraged to attend and view the original works of art created by the
Apprentices throughout the Summer. In addition to the commissioned wayfinding sculpture, the
BloomWorks group will be creating individual works of art such as wind chimes and decorative
“Little Libraries” which will be available for purchase at the sale.

St. Louis ArtWorks was founded in 1995 as a 501c3 collaborative partnership with Grand Center
Inc., the City of St. Louis, and the Regional Arts Commission. Since that time, ArtWorks has
provided opportunities for thousands of young people, successfully helping to prepare them for
future education and employment opportunities. ArtWorks bridges economic, racial, and social
divisions by providing underserved youth with arts education, workforce development training, and
21st century life skills, including fiscal literacy and professional communication. St. Louis ArtWorks
is currently funded in part by the Arts and Education Council.
