On Saturday, July 18, ArtWorks hosts its annual **SUMMER SALE**! This summer, the Apprentices were given the opportunity to create art about their **DREAMS**: the imaginitive musings of the sleeping mind, as well as dreams for their futures, and what they dream to see in their communities and the world around them.

More than 80 young artists will present original, dream-themed works of art for sale to the public. Stop by and find a one-of-a-kind treasure for yourself, or a gift for a friend. ArtWorks Apprentices have spent the summer creating sculptures, prints, dreamcatchers, photographs, cross-stitch, cards, videos, and animated poetry, as well as commissioned works for [The Nature Conservancy](http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/missouri/newsroom/apprentice-artists-explore-st-louis-parks-to-integrate-art-with-nature.xml) and Great Rivers Greenway.

**Cost: **Entrance to this event is **FREE** and open to the public!  
_Apprentice-made works of art are individually priced for sale._

**About ArtWorks:**  
The Mission of St. Louis ArtWorks is to broaden educational and career opportunities for youth in the St. Louis region through apprenticeships in the arts and through community collaborations.
